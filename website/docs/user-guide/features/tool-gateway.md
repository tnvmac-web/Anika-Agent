# __NEW_ORG__ Tool Gateway

**One subscription. Every tool built in.**

The Tool Gateway is included with every paid [__NEW_ORG__ Portal](https://portal.__NEW_DOMAIN__) subscription. It routes Anika' tool calls — web search, image generation, text-to-speech, and cloud browser automation — through infrastructure __NEW_ORG__ already runs, so you don't have to sign up with Firecrawl, FAL, OpenAI, Browser Use, or anyone else just to make your agent useful.

</div>

## What's included

| | Tool | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| 🔍 | **Web search & extract** | Agent-grade web search and full-page extraction via Firecrawl. No rate limits to worry about — the gateway handles scaling. |
| 🎨 | **Image generation** | Nine models under one endpoint: **FLUX 2 Klein 9B**, **FLUX 2 Pro**, **Z-Image Turbo**, **Nano Banana Pro** (Gemini 3 Pro Image), **GPT Image 1.5**, **GPT Image 2**, **Ideogram V3**, **Recraft V4 Pro**, **Qwen Image**. Pick per-generation with a flag, or let Anika default to FLUX 2 Klein. |
| 🔊 | **Text-to-speech** | OpenAI TTS voices wired into the `text_to_speech` tool. Drop voice notes into Telegram, generate audio for pipelines, narrate anything. |
| 🌐 | **Cloud browser automation** | Headless Chromium sessions via Browser Use. `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_vision` — all the agent-driving primitives, no Browserbase account required. |

All four are pay-as-you-use billed against your __NEW_ORG__ subscription. Use any combination — run the gateway for web and images while keeping your own ElevenLabs key for TTS, or route everything through __NEW_ORG__.

## Why it's here

Building an agent that can actually *do things* means stitching together 5+ API subscriptions — each with their own signup, rate limits, billing, and quirks. The gateway collapses that into one account:

- **One bill.** Pay Nous; we handle the rest.
- **One signup.** No Firecrawl, FAL, Browser Use, or OpenAI audio accounts to manage.
- **One key.** Your __NEW_ORG__ Portal OAuth covers every tool.
- **Same quality.** Same backends the direct-key route uses — just fronted by us.

Bring your own keys anytime — per-tool, whenever you want to. The gateway isn't a lock-in, it's a shortcut.

## Get started

There are three ways in — pick whichever fits where you are:

```bash
anika setup --portal     # Fresh install: __NEW_ORG__ OAuth + set __NEW_ORG__ as provider + turn on the Tool Gateway in one go
```

```bash
anika model              # Switch your inference provider to __NEW_ORG__ Portal — Anika then offers to turn on the gateway for all tools
```

```bash
anika tools              # Enable the gateway per-tool — pick "__NEW_ORG__ Subscription" for any tool you want
```

`anika setup --portal` and `anika model` are the all-at-once paths: log in once, optionally flip every tool to the gateway. `anika tools` is the à la carte path — turn on just the tools you want, one at a time.

**You don't have to log in first.** With `anika tools`, the Nous-managed backends (Web search, Image, Video, TTS, Browser) are always listed, even if you've never signed into __NEW_ORG__ Portal. Select one and Anika runs the Portal login right there if you aren't already authenticated — no need to run `anika model` beforehand. If your __NEW_ORG__ OAuth is already active, selecting the backend enables it immediately with no extra prompt. This path only logs you in and turns on the one tool you picked — it does **not** switch your inference provider, and it does **not** prompt you to enable the gateway for every other tool.

Check what's active at any time:

```bash
anika portal info        # Portal auth + Tool Gateway routing summary
anika portal tools       # Gateway catalog with current routing per tool
anika status             # Full system status (Tool Gateway is one section)
```

`anika portal info` shows a section like:

```
◆ __NEW_ORG__ Tool Gateway
  __NEW_ORG__ Portal     ✓ managed tools available
  Web tools       ✓ active via __NEW_ORG__ subscription
  Image gen       ✓ active via __NEW_ORG__ subscription
  TTS             ✓ active via __NEW_ORG__ subscription
  Browser         ○ active via Browser Use key
```

Tools marked "active via __NEW_ORG__ subscription" are going through the gateway. Anything else is using your own keys.

## Eligibility

The Tool Gateway is a **paid-subscription** feature. Free-tier __NEW_ORG__ accounts can use Portal for inference but don't include managed tools — [upgrade your plan](https://portal.__NEW_DOMAIN__/manage-subscription) to unlock the gateway.

Some accounts are also entitled to a **free tool pool** — a small managed-tool allowance that covers gateway tool calls without a paid subscription. When a free pool is available, the gateway surfaces it and shows a setup prompt on first use, so you can opt in and start using managed tools right away.

## The enablement checklist

Picking a __NEW_ORG__ model (`anika model`) offers a per-tool checklist of gateway backends. Its behavior respects your existing setup:

- Tools you've explicitly pointed at another backend (e.g. `web.backend: searxng`, `browser.cloud_provider: camofox`) are **never offered** — your selection can't be accidentally overwritten.
- Tools configured via environment variables alone (e.g. `SEARXNG_URL`, `CAMOFOX_URL`) are offered **unchecked**, labeled to keep your own backend.
- Only genuinely unconfigured tools come pre-checked.
- Declines stick: if you submit the checklist with a tool unchecked, it won't be pre-checked on future __NEW_ORG__ model swaps (stored in `tool_gateway_declined_tools` in `config.yaml`; checking it later clears the decline).

## Mix and match

The gateway is per-tool. Turn it on for just what you want:

- **All tools through Nous** — easiest; one subscription, done.
- **Gateway for web + images, bring your own TTS** — keep your ElevenLabs voice, let __NEW_ORG__ handle the rest.
- **Gateway only for things you don't have keys for** — "I already pay for Browserbase, but I don't want a Firecrawl account" works fine.

Switch any tool at any time via:

```bash
anika tools          # Interactive picker for each tool category
```

Select the tool, pick **__NEW_ORG__ Subscription** as the provider (or any direct provider you prefer). No config editing required. If you aren't logged into __NEW_ORG__ Portal yet, picking **__NEW_ORG__ Subscription** kicks off the Portal login inline — you don't need to authenticate through `anika model` first.

## Using individual image models

Image generation defaults to FLUX 2 Klein 9B for speed. Override per-call by passing the model ID to the `image_generate` tool:

| Model | ID | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| FLUX 2 Klein 9B | `fal-ai/flux-2/klein/9b` | Fast, good default |
| FLUX 2 Pro | `fal-ai/flux-2-pro` | Higher fidelity FLUX |
| Z-Image Turbo | `fal-ai/z-image/turbo` | Stylized, fast |
| Nano Banana Pro | `fal-ai/nano-banana-pro` | Google Gemini 3 Pro Image |
| GPT Image 1.5 | `fal-ai/gpt-image-1.5` | OpenAI image gen, text+image |
| GPT Image 2 | `fal-ai/gpt-image-2` | OpenAI latest |
| Ideogram V3 | `fal-ai/ideogram/v3` | Strong prompt adherence + typography |
| Recraft V4 Pro | `fal-ai/recraft/v4/pro/text-to-image` | Vector-style, graphic design |
| Qwen Image | `fal-ai/qwen-image` | Alibaba multimodal |

The set evolves — `anika tools` → Image Generation shows the current live list.

## Configuration reference

Most users never need to touch this — `anika model` and `anika tools` cover every workflow interactively. This section is for writing config.yaml directly or scripting setups.

### One selection key per tool category

Each tool category has a single provider-selection key, written by the `anika tools` picker (or the desktop GUI). Picking the **__NEW_ORG__ Subscription** row stores the value `nous`, which routes that category through the managed Tool Gateway. Picking a BYOK row stores the vendor name (`fal`, `openai`, `firecrawl`, `browser-use`, ...), which goes direct with your own credentials:

```yaml
web:
  backend: nous          # web search/extract via the Tool Gateway

image_gen:
  provider: nous         # image generation via the Tool Gateway

tts:
  provider: nous         # TTS via the Tool Gateway

stt:
  provider: nous         # speech-to-text via the Tool Gateway

browser:
  cloud_provider: nous   # cloud browser via the Tool Gateway
```

The runtime **always uses the stored selection** — credential presence never selects or reroutes a category. A `FAL_KEY` sitting in `.env` is ignored while `image_gen.provider: nous`; conversely, `image_gen.provider: fal` with no `FAL_KEY` set produces a clear error instead of silently falling back to the gateway:

```
image_gen is configured to use fal (set via anika tools), but FAL_KEY is not set. Run 'anika tools' to change it.
```

Categories you have **never configured** (no selection key ever written) autodetect from available credentials, same as before. But once a selection exists, adding a key to `.env` does not change the route — only `anika tools` (or editing the selection key) does.

### Switching back to your own keys

```bash
anika tools    # pick the tool → choose a direct provider (e.g. Firecrawl)
```

Or set the selection key directly:

```yaml
web:
  backend: firecrawl   # Anika now uses FIRECRAWL_API_KEY from .env
```

### Legacy `use_gateway` flag (deprecated)

Older Anika versions used a per-tool `use_gateway: true` boolean to route through the gateway. That flag is **legacy**: it is never written anymore, and the `anika tools` picker removes it from a category's config when it rewrites the selection. Old configs that still contain `use_gateway: true` are interpreted at read time as the `nous` selection, so existing setups keep working. Don't set `use_gateway` in new configs — select the provider in `anika tools` instead.

### Self-hosted gateway (advanced)

Running your own Nous-compatible gateway? Override endpoints in `~/.anika/.env`:

```bash
TOOL_GATEWAY_DOMAIN=your-domain.example.com
TOOL_GATEWAY_SCHEME=https
TOOL_GATEWAY_USER_TOKEN=your-token        # normally auto-populated from Portal login
FIRECRAWL_GATEWAY_URL=https://...         # override one endpoint specifically
```

These knobs exist for custom infrastructure setups (enterprise deployments, dev environments). Regular subscribers never set them.

## FAQ

### Does it work with Telegram / Discord / the other messaging gateways?

Yes. Tool Gateway operates at the tool-execution layer, not the CLI. Every interface that can call a tool — CLI, Telegram, Discord, Slack, IRC, Teams, the API server, anything — benefits from it transparently.

### What happens if my subscription expires?

Tools routed through the gateway stop working until you renew or swap in direct API keys via `anika tools`. Anika shows a clear error pointing at the portal.

### Can I see usage or costs per tool?

Yes — the [__NEW_ORG__ Portal dashboard](https://portal.__NEW_DOMAIN__) breaks usage down by tool so you can see what's driving your bill.

### Is Modal (serverless terminal) included?

Modal is available as an **optional add-on** through the __NEW_ORG__ subscription, not part of the default Tool Gateway bundle. Configure it via `anika setup terminal` or directly in `config.yaml` when you want a remote sandbox for shell execution.

### Do I need to delete my existing API keys when I enable the gateway?

No — keep them in `.env`. While a tool's selection is **__NEW_ORG__ Subscription**, direct keys for that tool are simply ignored. Pick the direct provider again in `anika tools` and your keys become the source again. The gateway isn't a lock-in.
